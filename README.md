Mobile architecture and design

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?




  The requirements and goals of the app I developed were to create an app for a user who was interested in tracking weight. There shall be a way to add in weight daily and a way to see that data. There shall also be a notification when that weight goal is reached. 

  Sceens necessary for this app were a login screeen, home screen, a dashboard screen to hold data, and a notifications screen. I utilized reserach and templates from andriod studio and Googles andriod principles website and I started designing with the User in mind. The designs were successful because they followed industry standards in terms of design.

  Coding the app was a lot more complicated than I had anticipated. Android studio is a very powerful tool for design, but I was struggling immensely to create a functioning application. I think more reserach and getting familiar with android studio will help me finalize the application. 

  The main challeges were getting familiar with android stuidio, but once I discovered the templates for design basics, it sped up the design and development time quite a bit. 

  I think my final project demonstrates how much I had learned from start to finish. With a little more time and reserach I know I could have a full fledged publishable app for android.
